The wound shattered his jaw and in keeping with Indian custom he was called Broken Jaw. He was rewarded for his bravery by being named a chief by Mistawasis. About 1940 or 05 he was named chief of the Mistawasis Band. He last became a medicine man and an elder in the Presbyterian church. He died on 22<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;of February, 1931 at the age of 80.</span></p>
